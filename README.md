# Weather Journal App
In this project I will use [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) to create a web app that gets the corresponding live temprature data of an entered zipcode in the US.

## Approach

* First, setting up the NODE.js which is essential for the project and installing its necessary packages like (express, body-parser and cors).
* Then, I signed up for my API credentials and got my API key from [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/).
* After that, creating the HTML and CSS files as required by the project rubric following the folder hierarchy.
* And then, I built my server js file and the app js file simultaneously adding one piece after another to get the final app as shown in the comments inside the files.
* Finally, modyfied my HTML and CSS files accordingly to match my final image of the app.

## Github Repository

I've updated my github repository after almost each of my daily sessions of working on the project so that you could follow up with the history and the building process of the files.
